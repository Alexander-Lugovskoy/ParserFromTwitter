[Sun May 09 16:08:07 +0000 2021] | Also, in the same way, a stereotypically good event can bring about bad fortunes. So, the next time you think that something unlucky or lucky happens, do not be too depressed or overjoyed. Go with the flow and take life one step at a time.
[Sun May 09 16:08:06 +0000 2021] | Nonetheless, the young man’s son was allowed to stay at home because he was physically disabled. The moral of his story is that when a bad event happens, that does not necessarily mean that the long-term results are disastrous.
[Sun May 09 16:08:06 +0000 2021] | Soon after, a war broke out on the border near the residence of Sai Weng. A draft was sending young people into the front fighting line of the army. There was a ninety-nine percent casualty rate.
[Sun May 09 16:08:05 +0000 2021] | People heard once again and came to comfort the elderly. But the old man was still not anxious. He even said that this might be a good thing! At that point, many of his neighbors and close friends thought that he was crazy and decided to leave him alone.
[Sun May 09 16:08:05 +0000 2021] | A few days later, the only child of the old man was riding on the good horse. The horse, unfamiliar with its new owner, ran wildly, slammed the young man down and wrestled his leg.  She landed on the son’s leg, and broke his leg, so that he would always walk with a limp.
[Sun May 09 16:08:04 +0000 2021] | But the old man, Sai Weng, was not happy. He said to everyone: “What can be congratulated, who can expect this is not a disaster!”
[Sun May 09 16:08:04 +0000 2021] | A few months have passed. One day, the old man’s lost horse actually returned and even brought back a good horse: a rare and valuable mare. This incident blew the whole village and people congratulated the old man.
[Sun May 09 16:08:03 +0000 2021] | The neighbors soon realized that there was nothing they could do to help get the horse back, and that they shouldn’t feel sad for the old man’s misfortune. He was not anxious, and smiled and said: “If the horse is lost, how can we tell if this is not a good thing?”
[Sun May 09 16:08:03 +0000 2021] | He explained to his neighbors that losing the horse wasn’t necessarily bad luck. There was no way to predict that the horse would escape, it just happened, and now there was nothing that could be done about it. “There is no reason to be upset,” said the old man.
[Sun May 09 16:08:02 +0000 2021] | One day, his good horse had suddenly disappeared after a servant left a stable door open. All of his neighbors, relatives, and friends, came up to him and consoled him for his loss. However, the gentle old man was not upset.
